# Student-Record-Management-System
Student Record Management System is a simple command-line application built using Java that allows users to manage student data through basic CRUD operations — add, view, search, and delete records. The application uses file handling to store student information persistently in a text file (students.txt), making it useful for understanding Java’s core I/O functionalities. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming, string manipulation, and exception handling in a real-world context. This project is ideal for Java beginners who want hands-on experience with file-based data storage and interactive CLI applications.
